Students will continue to learn from home as schools remain closed.    6. Restaurants and cafes can continue to operate, but only to serve take-away and delivery orders (no dine-in service).    7. Local places of worship (that only serve people in the neighborhood) can still operate, but with strict protocols and provided that they are not located in red zones. Big/renowned worship places (that serve people from all over Jakarta) must be closed.    8. Activities that can gather a crowd, e.g., reunions and large family gatherings, must not be held.    9. Public transportation will be limited (in the number of vehicles and the time). In Jakarta, the odd and even private cars restrictions will temporarily be stopped.    10.
